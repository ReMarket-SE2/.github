# 🛒 ReMarket

## Welcome to ReMarket!

We're building a simple, efficient marketplace application designed with modularity and scalability in mind.

## 🏗️ Repository Structure

Our codebase is organized into four main repositories:

- **[webapp](https://github.com/ReMarket-SE2/webapp)** - Full stack web application
- **[devops](https://github.com/ReMarket-SE2/devops)** - Infrastructure as code and deployment pipelines
- **[documentation](https://github.com/ReMarket-SE2/documentation)** - Comprehensive guides and API references

## 🚀 Getting Started

Check out our [documentation](https://github.com/ReMarket-SE2/documentation) repository for guides on setting up your development environment and contributing to the project.

## 🤝 Contributing

Currently we do not support contributions to the project, outside from organization members. For now you can only raise issues for project specification.
